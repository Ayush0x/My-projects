# My-project is known The Random Number Game
# I created my first project with JAVA programming, in which I have implemented a idea of a simple game where user is asked to guess a random number and then based on the user's guess whether correct or not user is updated.
# I made this project to improve my skills in the coding field, to learn new ways and implement the same in making or optimizing a new problem or existing in already present material.
# This is the first step for me to learn better ways of solving a problem and thinking out of the box improvisations.
# I made this project on java so it can work in any platform which have java compilers or java libraries.
# Feel free to let me know your suggestions and optimisations.
